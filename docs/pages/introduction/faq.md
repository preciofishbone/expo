In addition to the questions below, see the [forums](https://forums.expo.dev/) for more common questions and answers. Some of this information is repeated from earlier sections of the introduction but we include it here for comprehensiveness.

<Collapsible summary="Is Expo similar to React for web development?">

Expo and React Native are similar to React. You'll have to learn a new set of components (`View` instead of `div`, for example) and writing mobile apps is very different from websites; you think more in terms of screens and different navigators instead of separate web pages, but much more of your knowledge carries over than if you were writing a traditional Android or iOS app.

<Collapsible summary="What is the difference between Expo and React Native?">

Learn more about this on the [Already used React Native?](/workflow/already-used-react-native) page.

<Collapsible summary="How much does Expo cost?">

The Expo platform is [free and open source](https://blog.expo.dev/exponent-is-free-as-in-and-as-in-1d6d948a60dc). This includes the libraries that make up the [Expo SDK](/versions/latest/) and the [Expo CLI](/workflow/expo-cli/) used for development. The Expo Go app, the easiest way to get started, is also free from the app stores.

[Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas) is an optional suite of cloud services for Expo and React Native apps, from the Expo team. EAS makes it easier to build your app, submit it to the stores, keep it updated, send push notifications, and more. You can use EAS for free if the [Free tier](https://expo.dev/pricing) quotas are sufficient for your app. More information is available on the [pricing page](https://expo.dev/pricing).

<Collapsible summary="How do I add custom native code to my Expo managed project?">

Expo Go includes the most features from the [Expo SDK](/versions/latest/). To use other native modules in a managed project, you can use [Development Builds](/development/introduction).

<Collapsible summary="Can I use parts of Expo in my app that I created with React Native CLI?">

Yes! All Expo tools and services work great in any React Native app. For example, you can use any part of the [Expo SDK](/versions/latest/), [expo-dev-client](/development/installation) and EAS Build, Submit, and Update â€” they work great! [Learn more about installing Expo modules in your app](/bare/installing-expo-modules) and [how to get set up with EAS Build](/build/introduction).

<Collapsible summary="How do I share my Expo project? Can I submit it to the app stores?">

The fastest way to share your managed Expo project is to publish it and open it in a development client app. You can publish it by installing `expo-updates` in your project and running `expo publish`. This gives your app a URL; you can share this URL with anybody who has the Expo Go app for Android or the [Development Build](/development/introduction.md) for your app for iOS or Android, and they can open your app immediately.

When you're ready, you can create a standalone app (**.ipa** and **.aab**) for submission to Apple and Google's app stores. Expo will build the binary for you when you run one command; see [Building Standalone Apps](/distribution/app-stores). Apple charges $99/year to publish your app in the App Store and Google charges a $25 one-time fee for the Play Store. You can also use [internal distribution](/build/internal-distribution) to share your app with ad-hoc or enterprise provisioning on iOS and an APK on Android.
